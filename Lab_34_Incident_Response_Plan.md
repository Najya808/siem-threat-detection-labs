# Lab 34: Creating a Test Incident Response Plan

## Objectives
- Develop an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to effectively manage and mitigate cybersecurity incidents.
- Outline and define roles within the incident response team.
- Establish escalation procedures for various incident severities.
- Conduct a tabletop exercise to test and validate the response plan.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of cybersecurity principles.
- Familiarity with incident response frameworks like NIST or SANS.
- Access to a collaboration platform (e.g., Google Docs or a shared document editor).

## Task 1: Defining Roles and Responsibilities

### 1.1 Outline Key Roles
| Role                       | Description                                           |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Incident Response Manager    | Leads the incident response team and coordinates the response efforts |
| HOA Security Lead            | Assesses security posture and identifies vulnerabilities |
| IT Support                   | Provides technical assistance and implements security measures |

### 1.2 Assign Responsibilities
| Role                       | Responsibilities                                            |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incident Response Manager    | Coordinate incident response, communication, and reporting |
| HOA Security Lead            | Monitor security alerts, conduct assessments, and report findings |
| IT Support                   | Implement technical solutions, recover affected systems    |

## Task 2: Establishing Escalation Procedures

### 2.1 Define Severity Levels
- **Low Severity**: Minor incidents; minimal operational impact.
- **Medium Severity**: Partial system downtime or limited data exposure.
- **High Severity**: Critical incidents; major disruption or sensitive data breach.

### 2.2 Escalation Steps for Each Severity

- **Low Severity**
  - Notify IT Support.
  - Resolve within 24 hours.
  - Document in the incident management system.

- **Medium Severity**
  - Notify IT Support and HOA Security Lead immediately.
  - Response within 4 hours.
  - Report findings to Incident Response Manager.

- **High Severity**
  - Alert Incident Response Manager immediately.
  - Assemble full incident response team.
  - Prepare external communications team if necessary.
  - Conduct full investigation and detailed reporting.

## Task 3: Conducting a Mini Tabletop Exercise

### 3.1 Prepare a Scenario
- Example: A phishing attack leads to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### 3.2 Walkthrough the Incident Response Plan
1. **Simulate Detection:** Initiate the scenario by simulating detection of the incident.
2. **Notify the Team:** Follow notification procedures defined in the IRP.
3. **Discuss Actions:** Role-play response actions, discuss decisions, and record findings.

## Conclusion
- Successfully created a foundational Incident Response Plan tailored to cybersecurity incidents.
- Defined key roles and responsibilities.
- Established escalation procedures based on incident severity.
- Validated the plan through a tabletop exercise.
- This lab provides a foundation to improve organizational readiness and response capabilities.
